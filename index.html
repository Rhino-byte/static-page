        "Tomatoes were once thought to be poisonous. In the 18th century, Europeans called them 'poison apples' because aristocrats would get sick after eating them off pewter plates, which had high lead content. The acidity of the tomatoes would leach lead from the plates, causing lead poisoning.",
        
        "Honey never spoils. Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. This is due to honey's low water content and natural acidity, which prevent bacteria and microorganisms from growing.",
        
        "The average American eats nearly 6,000 slices of pizza in their lifetime. The U.S. consumes around 3 billion pizzas annually, with pepperoni being the most popular topping. The world's most expensive pizza, the 'Louis XIII,' costs over $12,000 and includes caviar, lobster, and 24K gold flakes.",
        
        "Apples float in water because they are made up of 25% air. This unique structure makes them not only crisp and delicious but also perfect for traditional games like bobbing for apples.",
        
        "Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. Botanically speaking, a berry must develop from a single ovary and contain seeds on the inside. Bananas meet this criterion, but strawberries do not, as their seeds are on the outside.",
        
        "Chocolate was once used as currency. The ancient Aztecs valued cacao beans so highly that they used them to buy goods and services. You could actually trade 100 cacao beans for a turkey or exchange them for services like haircuts.",
        
        "Pineapples take about two years to grow and each plant only produces one fruit per season. The fruit actually consists of dozens of individual flowerets that fuse together around the core. Talk about patience for a sweet reward!",
        
        "The smell of fresh-cut grass is actually a plant distress call. The scent is a chemical compound released by the plant when it is damaged, signaling to other plants nearby to protect themselves.",
        
        "Carrots were originally purple, red, yellow, and white. The orange variety we know today was cultivated by Dutch growers in the 17th century as a tribute to William of Orange and has since become the most common type.",
        
        "The world's largest pumpkin weighed over 2,700 pounds. Pumpkin festivals around the world celebrate this massive fruit, with competitions for the heaviest pumpkin and even pumpkin boat races!",
        
        "Watermelons are 92% water, making them incredibly hydrating. In ancient Egypt, they were often placed in the tombs of pharaohs to nourish them in the afterlife.",
        
        "Broccoli contains more protein per calorie than steak. While you’d need to eat a lot more broccoli to match a steak’s protein, it's a fantastic option for those looking to increase their protein intake while keeping calories low.",
        
        "Avocados are technically a berry. They are also known as 'alligator pears' due to their bumpy skin. Avocados are incredibly nutritious, packed with healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.",
        
        "Potatoes were the first food to be grown in space. In 1996, NASA and the University of Wisconsin partnered to grow spuds on the Space Shuttle Columbia. This experiment was a step toward long-term food production in space.",
        
        "Cucumbers are fruits, not vegetables. They develop from the flower of the cucumber plant and contain seeds inside. Additionally, cucumbers are incredibly hydrating, containing about 95% water."
